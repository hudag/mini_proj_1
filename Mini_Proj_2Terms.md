## How Python uses Indentation to Control Flow
    
  * Control flow in your code is when the order that your program is executed is affected. Python uses whitespace to delimit scope. Each block must start with the same amount of whitespace (one or more). For example if you have a for loop in mython the code you wish to have a part of the for loop needs to be indented. 
    
  * Here is an example of the use of the for loop with the proper use of whitepace.

    * Here is an example of using/not using DRY programming practices.
