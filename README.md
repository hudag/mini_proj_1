The usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company. The way this is possible is because through platforms such as Git and Docker you are able to collaborate with your team members and locate problems early on because it uses continuous integration. 

Team members must integrate the code they have a few times a day. Git, for example, will check if it automatically will be able to be merged. If it is not done automatically you are able to see there is a problem that has to be manually solved. 

To create files in the file system you have to create and edit files. This is done through the [Vi command](/writing.md).

To manage the file system the command line is used on Linux with basic commands. To see some of the most basic Linux commands to help manage your file systems use the [Basic Linux Commands Page](/linux.md)
