# Tutorial & gitFlow

## Repository
* A repository is a file location where you store all the files that relate to your project.
* - **Local Repository: ** Local repository is a folder on your machine which contails files, folders and code that you used for your project.
* - **Remote Repository: ** A remote repository is located in a remote location ie the web. A good example of remote repository is Github.

## Clone
* Git clone is a git command which created a copy of a targeted repository in your local machine

## Fork
* Fork is similar to clone. A fork is a copy of repository on which we can make changes without changing the original repository. Unlike clone, a forked repository does not exist on your local machine, it would exist on webserver like Githubs webserver.
------------
## Branch
* In git you can create different branches. It can be thought of as a parallel version of the project where you can safely make changes without interfering in other people codebase. Once the development is completed in the diverged branch is can be merged back with the original or master branch.
